## Abstract

This EIP extends the NFT metadata JSON schema defined in [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md), adding a `upgrade history` key that provides information about how the NFT data is stored. 

## Motivation

TODO

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

In addition to the existing properties, the Metadata JSON file returned by [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) smart contracts (via `tokenURI` and `uri` methods, respectively), should OPTIONALLY contains one more `upgrade history` property.

For [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) smart contracts, the Metadata JSON file schema is:

```json
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "upgrade_history": [{
        "metadata": {
            "title": "Asset Metadata",
